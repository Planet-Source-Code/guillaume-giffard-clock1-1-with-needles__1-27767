It is a clock with needles that uses simple geometric functions, the VB's time functions and  whose dial resizes with the form. This program shows you how to use the VB's time functions and how to build moving needles. To make the dial be resiable I have written the main functions in the Form_Resize function. I've add the Language menu for the program can be readen in english or in french.
